# Welcome to the Scroll org repos!

Scroll is its own Layer 2 network built on Ethereum (more specifically, a “zero-knowledge rollup”).

If you’re experienced in building on Ethereum, your code, dependencies, and tooling work with Scroll out of the box. This is possible because our network is compatible with EVM bytecode and designed to feel just like developing on Ethereum.

For more on deploying on Scroll, see our [Developer Documentation](https://guide.scroll.io/developers/).
